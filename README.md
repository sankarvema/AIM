Applied Intelligence Models
========

Applied Intelligence Models (AIM) is an artificial intelligence modeling project aimed at building AI and ML models for Text Mining and Anomaly Detection. These models can be used to analyze log scale system / application logs to predict / identify usage anomalies which can provide administrator an insight into usage scenarios and help detect potential system failure or security threats.

Some of the potential usage scenarios

1. Log Mining
2. Security threat analysis like DOS, DDOS
3. Application / System behavior prediction to identify potential failures
4. Predictive maintenance of machine (when extended with machine interface devices or IoT)
